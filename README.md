# mongosharp
MongoSharp is a Windows based UI tool for executing queries against [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) collections. Although there are many query tools on the market MongoSharp is uniqe in that it allows you to write [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) based queries in C# (hence the name). Of course it is also free and open source.
